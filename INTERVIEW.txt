Challenges:

1. Make the alterations to this repo necessary so that `bootstrap.sh` produces 
   good output, which should be some ASCII art of an ellipse.

2. The `python/bin/make_ellipse.py` program requires too many input variables to 
   be invoked correctly (see `bootstrap.sh` for example usage).  Change the 
   input to this program such that it takes a `.yaml` file as an input instead.

3. We want to build a docker image for this ellipse renderer so that it can be 
   easily shared with others. Make alterations to the `Dockerfile` so that it
   successfully builds the image. NOTE: The docker image should contain only
   the necessary files for `bootstrap.sh` to run with good output.
